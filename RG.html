                    		During the literature review and information hunting, a range of researches and tools developed to achieve the task of the conducting research could be found. Although they may seem exactly the same at first glance, what the proposed system can achieve goes beyond what has already been achieved by the prevailing conducted researches and developed tools.
                      	<br>
                      	<br>
					  		One feature which was common to all the researches but not to all the tools is the usage of single data source. When accessing the data from social media, most of the researches have turned their attention towards Twitter, whereas analytic tools provide the opportunity to use multiple social media. The proposed solution is based on multiple social media data sources, but mainly the attention would be focused on Twitter and Facebook as they are placed in top most five results of the most popular social networks.
						<br>
                      	<br>
						  Another feature that came to attention was preprocessing of data. All the solutions proposed in conducted researches and tools, follow a series of preprocessing techniques before data storage. Although they preprocess direct data from APIs, none of them use feature extraction and removal of non-related data. In the proposed solution, the data would undergo a chain of preprocessing techniques and feature extraction along with a mechanism to remove non-related reviews. In feature extraction, all the related features which are necessary in analyzation will be extracted so that storage space won’t be wasted unnecessarily and to obtain higher processing speed. Further, with the intention of fast and time saving processing, non-related reviews to a particular post would be removed before storage.
						<br>
                      	<br>
						  In concern of semantic and sentiment analysis of comments, what can be seen is that, although there are many researches conducted based on them in related to comments published on social media, none of them is performed to enterprise domain to which the proposed solution would apply.
						<br>
						<br>
						  A huge amount of researches and tools can be found in related to sentiment analysis of comments published on social media. This basic sentiment analysis would categorize the comments as positive, negative and neutral. The solution proposed would move a step forward and take sentiment analysis deeper by categorizing comments into six main emotions, namely, happy, sad, angry, disgust, fear and surprise according to Paul Ekman. We use vector space model for this classification and by using latent semantic analysis we try to increase efficiency of emotion classification algorithm.
						<br>
						<br>
						  All the previously conducted researches on sentiment analysis and opinion mining, just focuses in identifying and separating the comment which contains a suggestion. Again, the proposed solution would take semantic analysis deeper by giving the weightage of the suggestion considering amount of times that suggestion has been repeated throughout the comments. Further, for the convenience of the users of the proposed solution, the suggestions would be summarized as feature, polarity pairs where polarity would be either positive or negative.
						<br>
						<br>
						  Since every social media analyzing tool rely on basic measurement scores namely number of likes, shares and comments, proposed solution would build advanced relationships beyond the common patterns by manipulating relationships with human emotions which extracted from the comments. By calculating probabilities and measurements of all the possible social key performance indicators(KPIs) with real time, success rate of the post can be derived more accurately. Furthermore, the graphs and diagrams with statistically descripted charts can be produced to the user.
						<br>
						<br>
						  Following are the list of features to be examined or produced by proposed solution. Even though some features are available on other analytical tools mentioned below, the way they monitored and data engagement with social media metrics are much more simple and direct without digging into further analysis. Besides, getting number of
						  likes, comments and shares are most common feature of all the time and export them into a PDF or reporting mechanism is another common area found.
